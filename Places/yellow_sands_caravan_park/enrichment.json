      "description": "Yellow Sands is a large and legendary family holiday resort located at the scenic mouth of the Kwelera River, a short drive north of East London. Renowned for its prime location that offers the best of both worlds—a vast, unspoiled beach and a safe, tidal river lagoon—it has been a cherished destination for generations of campers, surfers, and fishermen. The park features a vast expanse of grassed sites, many offering spectacular views of the river mouth and the Indian Ocean.\n\nAs one of the premier resorts on the Eastern Cape coast, it buzzes with a lively and social atmosphere, especially during school holidays. It's a self-contained destination with excellent on-site facilities, including a well-stocked shop and a popular pub and restaurant. Whether it's for a weekend getaway or an extended summer holiday, Yellow Sands provides a classic South African coastal camping experience focused on family, fishing, and fun.",
      "the_vibe": "- **Classic Family Holiday:** A bustling, energetic park filled with families, kids on bikes, and the hum of a traditional beach vacation.\n- **Angler's & Surfer's Hub:** The atmosphere is geared towards ocean lovers, with a strong focus on fishing from the rocks and river, and surfing the famous point break.\n- **Social & Lively:** This is a large, popular resort, not a quiet retreat. Expect to socialize with neighbours and enjoy a communal holiday spirit.",
      "need_to_know": "### Serious Wind Factor\nThe point is very exposed to coastal winds. Heavy-duty storm pegs and windbreaks are not optional; they are essential for a comfortable stay.\n\n### Book a Year in Advance\nThis is one of the Eastern Cape's most popular resorts. Prime sites for the December/January season are often booked up to a year in advance by regulars.\n\n### Tidal River Crossing\nAccess to the main beach from the campsite often requires wading through the river mouth, the depth of which changes with the tide. Plan beach trips accordingly.",
