Heidi and Taryn went above and beyond to ensure my family and I were comfortable and provided plenty information that assisted us to make a better decision every step of the way. This kinda service is extremely rare. Aiden was knowledgeable and welcomed us warmly. He even assisted to spray down  and clean my car car from the tar I picked up on the road. This place is a piece of paradise and my kids also loved it. All the other campers were friendly and welcomed us as well. We will be back and this time for a month. Keep up the amazing work team.",

Laundry ladies are a blessing on rainy days. You can even arrange ladies to clean your camp site while you are at the beach. Completely kids friendly, and what surprised us, is everyone just leaves there belongings and fetches it later, without ever worrying about it being taken. Absolutely love that about this place. Experience overall was just amazing. Will definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful, experience with breathtaking scenery.",

      "text": "First time at the resort.... can't really call it a caravan park because it is the most beautiful resort i have seen in a very long time. We have friends that has one of the houses (surname Greeff) that invited us for a week with them. The overall experience was unbelievable except for all the beers that i had to drink with everyone. The lodge had a lot of entertainment for the kids and even on the beach at night with massive bomb fires and entertainment. It is really safe and the first time that i have seen the people leave their Gazebos with chairs, boogy boards etc on the beach for their duration of their stay. The camping sites are really well placed and really spacious with a lot of them with really good views of the ocean and beach. We will definetly go there again and i will even consider to buy one of the houses there when i can. Worth every cent. Well done to the management and staff on a 7 star resort.",

Management and admin very helpful and efficient. Ablutions are clean but a bit dated. Swimming pool is great and having access to both the beach and lagoon is a great plus. Can get very busy over weekends, but a wonderful camping experience for sure.",
