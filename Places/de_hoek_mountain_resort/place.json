They gave our chalets to other guests because they had a music festival which was ending the next day. They placed us in a dormitory the first night. The next morning we had to wait for our chalet to be cleaned and had to move all of our stuff we which we unpacked from the dormitory, the had to pack and move all of it into the chalet. They told us that they are waiting for next the next available chalet for us meaning they never booked one for us in the first place ( which we booked 5 months ago) they said their was a mistake made and they booked us for 2 Jan - 5 Jan, but our invoice clearly said we booked from 1 Jan - 4 Jan. they clearly made room for the music festival guests since they were pumping more money into the resort. Because we heard the same thing happens to our neighbours at the chalet.\nNever returning to De Hoek.",
