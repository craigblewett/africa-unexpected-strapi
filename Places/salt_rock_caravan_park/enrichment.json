      "raw_data": "Salt Rock Caravan Park is located on the beachfront in Salt Rock, on the Dolphin Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, approximately 15 minutes north of Ballito. The park features around 130 terraced sites, many of which offer sea views. Sites are grassed, with shade provided by coastal trees, and are equipped with standard 220V electricity points and shared water taps. The park is renowned for its clean and well-maintained ablution facilities, which include hot showers, flush toilets, and baths. Additional facilities include a communal scullery for dishwashing, laundry facilities with coin-operated machines, a children's playground with swings, and a recreation room with a TV. The entire park is fenced and has 24-hour security with controlled gate access. The main feature is the direct access to the Salt Rock main beach and the large tidal pool. The subtropical climate means hot, humid summers and mild, dry winters. Hazards include vervet monkeys and strong sea currents outside of the tidal pools. Bookings for peak holiday seasons are essential and must be made many months, sometimes over a year, in advance. The park is located close to convenience stores, restaurants, and the main attractions of Ballito, including the Ballito Lifestyle Centre and Junction Mall for comprehensive shopping.",
      "experiences_raw": "On-site activities are centred around the ocean. Swimming and snorkeling in the large, safe tidal pool is the primary activity for families. The surrounding rocks are popular for surf and rock angling. The main Salt Rock beach offers good conditions for surfing and bodyboarding. During low tide, the rock pools can be explored for marine life. The coastline is famous for dolphin sightings year-round, and whale watching is common during the winter months (June-November). The park's location allows for easy beach walks to nearby Granny's Pool or north towards Thompson's Bay. Nearby activities include exploring the local Salt Rock village with its restaurants and shops. A short drive to Ballito opens up a wide range of dining, shopping, and entertainment options. Other popular local beaches include Shaka's Rock and Thompson's Bay, with its own large tidal pool and 'Hole in the Wall'. Adventure activities on the Dolphin Coast include microlight flights, surfing lessons, and deep-sea fishing charters launching from Durban."
