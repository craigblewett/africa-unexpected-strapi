      "text": "What a wonderful park! Central to all the hot spots on the north coast, we were treated to a stunning sighting of dolphins passing by whilst we setup camp. The staff are friendly, respectful and helpful. The overall vibe is quiet although I think in peak season it may feel a bit cramped if you enjoy a more private campsite. We had stand 28 on the beachfront and were so delighted that each space had an awesome astroturf section for your cozy campsite. We found this especially unique and added that little extra comfort to our campsite which was really appreciated especially when you're used to a sandy campsite experience! We found the rates a little higher than the average prices we have paid around Southern Africa but we were pleased with the overall experience and you don't often get to leave camp and walk straight onto the beach or head up to the Salt Rock Hotel for the ultimate dining experience. We have definitely added this spot to our off season frequent stop!",
