      "text": "It's a gorgeous campsite and place to stay in Buffalo Bay if you don't get to stay in a house. The whole town is very cute and you're able to walk anywhere you want within a few minutes. The beach is also beautiful with a large sand dune to climb, big waves for surfers, and many rock pools for fishing or exploring the marine life for kids. The campsite itself has beautiful grass fields and the ablutions are in decent condition, however the showers are a bit poorly designed to keep the water from splashing on your clothes. There are tiny stools you can put your clothes on however. At the campsite your basically surrounded by ocean all the way around so sunsets and sunrises are beautiful. You might also be able to spot dolphins or whales in the distance. There is also a playground for the kids and designated braai areas for most spots. Highly recommend it not only for the campsite but for the whole town.",

The staff was friendly and helpful. We intended to stay one night but like it so much we stayed for two nights. Although it was over a long weekend, it wasn't too crowded or noisy. Will definitely be back!",
