      "description": "Buffalo Bay Caravan Park holds one of the most sought-after locations on the Garden Route, positioned on a narrow spit of land with the Indian Ocean on one side and the tranquil Goukamma River estuary on the other. This municipal-managed park is a classic South African beach holiday destination, prized for its direct, unparalleled access to the sand and surf rather than for luxury amenities. It offers a traditional, no-frills camping and caravanning experience where the natural surroundings are the main attraction.\n\nThe park consists of grassed stands, many with spectacular, uninterrupted sea views. It is immensely popular with families, surfers, and anglers who return year after year. The atmosphere is relaxed and community-oriented, especially during the bustling summer holidays. Its position within the Goukamma Nature Reserve provides a unique blend of coastal and fynbos environments, making it a prime base for beach activities, water sports, and nature trails.",

      "raw_data": "Buffalo Bay Caravan Park is located in the small coastal village of Buffalo Bay, approximately 20 km from Knysna on the Garden Route, Western Cape. Access is via a paved road and is suitable for all standard vehicles and caravans. The park is managed by the Buffalo Bay Home Owners Association and operates within the boundaries of the CapeNature-managed Goukamma Nature Reserve. It features over 80 demarcated stands for caravans and tents, most of which are grassed. A significant number of sites are prime beachfront stands. All sites are equipped with 220V electricity points. Shared ablution blocks are well-maintained and provide hot-water showers, flush toilets, and laundry facilities. There are also communal dishwashing areas. Due to its location within a protected area, pets are strictly not permitted.\n\nThe park's main draw is its geography, occupying a peninsula between a sandy surf beach and the Goukamma River mouth. This provides both safe swimming for children in the lagoon and excellent surfing conditions on the main beach. The park has controlled access with security. Bookings, especially for the peak season (December-January) and Easter holidays, are essential and often need to be made a year or more in advance. The climate is temperate, with warm summers and mild, wetter winters. The Southern Right Whale migration occurs from June to November. The area is low-risk for malaria. A small shop and restaurant are located adjacent to the park within the village.",
      "experiences_raw": "On-site and immediate activities are water-focused. Surfing and bodyboarding are premier activities on the main beach. The Goukamma estuary offers safe swimming, stand-up paddleboarding (SUP), and canoeing/kayaking in calm waters. Fishing is popular, with options for rock and surf angling from the beach and rock ledges, as well as estuary fishing. The beach provides long stretches for walking and running. Birdwatching is excellent, with coastal species like gulls, cormorants, and the African Black Oystercatcher, plus estuary waders.\n\nNearby activities are extensive. The park is a trailhead for several hikes in the Goukamma Nature Reserve, including the popular coastal trail to Platbank. The town of Knysna (20-min drive) offers the Knysna Waterfront for shopping and dining, boat trips to the Knysna Heads, and forest tours. The Sedgefield area (15-min drive) is famous for the Saturday Wild Oats Community Farmers' Market. Further afield, Wilderness offers canoeing on the Touw River and viewpoints like the Map of Africa. Day trips can include Plettenberg Bay for whale watching charters, Monkeyland, or Birds of Eden.",
