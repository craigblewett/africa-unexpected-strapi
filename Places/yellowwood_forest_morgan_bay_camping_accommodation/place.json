It was absolutely wonderful, the campsites are so beautiful (we got a stunning one right on the river) and spotlessly clean/natural, the toilets and showers are quirky and lovely. The volunteers and staff that work there are so helpful and kind, and are passionate about the forest walks... the restaurant serves lovely food. A very special peaceful and safe place. We will be back!",

Some things are a bit worn down and seem a bit older but nothing that really bothered us. We visited in the beginning of April and there weren't a lot of visitors on the grounds.\n\nBut everyone working there was very kind and we had a lovely vegetarian curry.\n\nThanks for the great stay!",

      "text": "Please I need help üôèüôèüôè\n\nI have been living and trading at Yellowwood market in Morgan bay over the past year. I have put my heart and soul into my little business and have worked hard. I do a small archery range where I give lessons and make bows.\n\nDecember unfortunately I got rained out so I put all my time, effort and money into the Easter weekend. There was a festival for the weekend arranged 4 months prior. The owner of yellowwood only started the banners and marketing for the festival ON THE DAY THE MARKET STARTED. This gives indication of lack of organisation.\n\nThe same day they said to me that I have to move my archery range to the corner of the property and blocked off all the main thoroughfare to the area I was allocated as seen in the photos. They had 4 months to make the arrangements but closed me down on the first day of the season.\n\nSo instead of making approximately R 12000 for the weekend, I'm sitting with no food in my house, having to beg for bread and R2 to my name.\n\nThis is the 7th time they have done this to me (at the last moment) over the past year.\n\nThe day I was supposed to move in here originally, they also said at the last moment that they had changed plans and left me on the streets.\n\nDo you feel I deserve compensation for their incompetence and neglect of arrangements or am I in the wrong?\n\nPlease comment üôèüôèüôè I am now desperate ...",
