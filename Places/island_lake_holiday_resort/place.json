Personally I have not stayed over there but, I have stayed close by and have been to explore the resort. Therefore as I have not stayed over is the reason for me giving 3 stars and not more. Personally I would love to book in there sometime in the near future to experience that which I have not been able to observe and enjoy. Thanks",

Constant checking up if we are over camp site boundaries while his regulars  park on over lines on our camp site. Braaier height was measured and 1 ground sail was required but some other ppl had no ground sails for any of their tents.",

The fishing from the resort did not happened from the side as there was like 30 plus boats anchored next to the only available access for fishing. With the boats up and down, there is anyway no fish around. The hosts are very pleasant people and they have arranged a very pleasant spitbraai old year's Eve gathering. The caterer for this spitbraai I will recommend any day. Their lamb was soft, tasty and the side dishes delicious!",
