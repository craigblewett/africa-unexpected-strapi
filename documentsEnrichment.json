Many campers pack a picnic and spend an afternoon here away from the bustle, with children splashing in the shallow edges and adults relaxing on smooth rocks under the canopy."

Half buried in sand and sea grass, the wreck has become part of the landscape, with rusted iron ribs jutting out like sculptures. It makes for a fascinating photo stop and sparks the imagination about maritime trade routes and storms from centuries past."
