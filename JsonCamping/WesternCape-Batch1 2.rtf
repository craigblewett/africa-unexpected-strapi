It offers 68 caravan and tent sites and 23 self-catering chalets amid Karoo-air landscapes and mature trees. The resort features a naturally heated outdoor pool (up to 35 \'b0C) for cold seasons, a generous cold pool for hot summer days, plus three dams for catch-and-release fishing and water-slides. Ideal for families or groups seeking shade, space and a restful break, it blends Karoo tranquillity with accessible convenience.\\n\\nThe mood is relaxed but structured: there are club rules (especially for quiet hours and membership prioritisation at peak times) and a well-maintained setting with both sons of nature and creature comforts. Whether you're in a tent under trees or staying in a chalet, you\'92ll find yourself within easy reach of Montagu\'92s vineyards and Route 62 drives, yet removed enough to feel away from the city buzz.",\

It offers a blend of outdoor adventure (4\'d74 trails, air-soft, climbing) and relaxed bush-camping, making it well suited to groups, families and active travellers.\\n\\nThe overall feeling is that of an event-camp or escape venue rather than a commercial resort: you\'92ll find good facilities, plenty of space and an emphasis on nature and activity, rather than luxury or crowds. Whether you\'92re doing a team-build, multi-day trail or simply setting up the caravan for a weekend, it offers a flexible base for West Coast exploration.",\
