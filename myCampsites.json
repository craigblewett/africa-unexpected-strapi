The resort blends powered caravan and tent sites, self-catering chalets and family-oriented amenities such as large swimming pools and kids’ play parks. There’s a country-feel setting with shady lawns, farm-animals, a café and bar, yet handy access to coast and city amenities.\n\nWhether you’re pitching a tent, parking a caravan or booking a chalet, you’ll find plenty of space, a relaxed pace and the infrastructure to keep kids entertained while parents unwind. A handy base for day excursions to the Cape’s coast, wine-country or city, and a comfortable holiday park rather than back-to-nature austerity.",

        "need_to_know": "### Book early for school-holiday peaks\nSites fill quickly during Cape Town school holidays and special events—reserve ahead.\n\n### Strict no-music policy at day-visitor hours\nAlthough there’s a bar and café, the resort enforces no-music policies for day visitors; bring your own games rather than party gear. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n\n### Ground cover and vehicle access vary\nSome sites are grass/soil lawn surfaces; standard vehicles are fine but loose ground near grass or after rain may need a little more care.",

It suits couples, active groups and families wanting nature over resort frills—comfortable but decidedly in the wild.",
